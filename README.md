**PROJECT PROPOSAL â€“ TEAM FoodIsGood**

**Project Name: Bumper Tanks**

**Introduction &amp; Description**

- We will be developing a birds-eye view 2D tank game.
- 4 Players will be able to play in a multiplayer match.
- Tanks will be able to drive around, shoot at each other, bump into other players or obstacles.
- Tanks will have editable starting traits such as weight and weapon size so that players can make tradeoffs in terms of health vs. speed and weapon damage vs. fire rate.
- Power ups can be picked up from the map such as explosive bullets, speed boost, health packs, grappling hooks, etc.
- All objects on the arena floor will have full physics support so that tanks or explosions can cause blocks &amp; other tanks to be pushed around.
- This game is a mashup of bumper cars and tank games, as such it is an original idea with no current implementation.
- Players will be able to message/taunt other players through a messaging channel
- This games is targeted at all ages and is simply used for enjoyment.

**Project Scope**

- This project has a few core feature/infrastructure epics which will be essential to the game such as: Database for login, Object modelling system which will include physics &amp; graphics subsystems, server update system so that real-time multiplayers is possible.
- There will be many more smaller feature stories which serve to enhance the enjoyment of the game such as: power up system, tank customizing system, chat system.
- Some stories may be dedicated to cleaning/modularizing code so that it can accept future update stories such as selecting a server.
